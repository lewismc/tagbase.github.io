{"name":"Tagbase","tagline":"a simple data management system for electronic tags on marine animals","body":"# Tagbase #\r\n\r\nTagbase is a relational database application for the management of biologging data from electronic tags deployed on various marine animals. Tagbase implements a comprehensive relational model handling archival, pop-up archival satellite and telemetry tag files from all major tag manufacturers. Implemented in Microsoft Access, this application can be easily ported to a variety of database management systems across platforms.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out our journal article too -\r\n\r\n> [Lam CH, Tsontos VM (2011) Integrated Management and Visualization of Electronic Tag Data with Tagbase.
